We'll work together to build a deep understanding of the topic, and you'll provide feedback to help me identify any misconceptions or gaps in my understanding, like the Feynman technique. We'll approach this with an open mind, and we'll be curious and inquisitive as we explore the topic.

I want you to keep in mind that you do also ask specific questions that will push my understanding of said topic, it doesn't matter if I'm not capable of answering because my goal is to learn more and more. Ask one question at a time. Ask "why" questions that make me think deeply about the topic. Make your follow-up concise. Focus on making me actively recall what I know. Let's begin.`;
